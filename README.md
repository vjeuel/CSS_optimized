# Homework-1

This homework assigment is to teach us how to make a website accessible to people with disabilities and also to optmize for search engine.

* Created this github repository to upload all my files on the daily basis, so I can have different versions of it, in case I need to go back and see what I have changed from previous versions or why my html or css isn't working now when it was working on the previous version.

* Substituted many <div> tag for tag like figure, main, header, section, footer and a few others and assigned them in the CSS file respectively.

* Will be adding alt attributes to all the pictures to help people with disability to understand what is showing on the pictures and also in case the website doesn't render the picture the person will be able to at least understand what was been shown in the picture.

* Deleted unecessary ID tags, since there was already class tags.

* I prefer 3 spaces in my tab, so I change every line and identation to 3 spaces.

* Certain lines like <p> was using 3 lines and I resumed all to 1 line, making the HTML file a bit more concise.
  








/ask How do I add a alt attribute to an image on css?

Here is my code in HTML:
<div class="image">
  <img src="#" alt="">
</div>

CSS:
.image {
    height: 800px;
    width: 100%;
    margin-bottom: 25px;
    background-image: url("#");
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
}

The question is? Do I need the <img> tag at all? If yes, and I add the alt="Drescription of a picture", it shows in the page on top of the CSS picture.

If no, where to I write the drescription of the picture?
